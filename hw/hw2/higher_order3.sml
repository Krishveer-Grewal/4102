(*In this exercise, you'll use map and filter—two built-in higher-order functions in SML—to manipulate lists.
Task 1: Use map to add 2 to each number in a list.

    map takes a function and a list, and applies the function to every element in the list.

Task 2: Use filter to keep only even numbers from a list.

    filter takes a predicate function (a function that returns true or false) and a list, and returns a new list containing only the elements for which the predicate returns true.*)
